This is a template and instructions for creating your own Assignment0.

## Instructions

### 5. Make changes

- a. Change `# Assignment 0 Instructions` to `# John Smith` substituting your proper name for `John Smith`
- b. Commit and push up to github using the lessons that Trevor gives you on Github Desktop. Refresh the github page, and examine to see if you like it (excepting instructions still showing).
- c. If you want to do the extra credit (see below), do that before the next step because you will need it for pathing help.
- d. Delete all the instructions text from this file.
- e. Push up to github again, refresh and examine.
- f. [repeat until satisfied with result per below.]

## Testing Your Assignment

If your github handle was `petecarapetyan` and your name was `John Smith` and you had your browser set on dark theme then this is what your completed `Assignment0` page would look like.

At this time, we do not review Assignment0, it is for your personal education only, so do not hand it in to the Assignments App like you would with Assignments 1-15

## Extra Credit

Learning how to path images (or any files, for that matter) is a frequent stumbling block for new coders. To illustrate this point, please examine this document and see how all of the images are pathed in this markup file, from the images directory. Such as `/images/complete.jpg` above.

For extra credit even before you will need it on Assignment 1, place a photograph of yourself in the images directory and make it show properly, such as below.

Hopefully your smile will look every bit as dorky as mine.

File path problems are very typical for most students in assignments 1 and 3. This is a good thing to learn early and get out of the way. If you don't understand how I got `/images/Pete.jpg` as the file path feel free to consult bard or chatgpt or any other AI.

## Should I repeat Assignment0?

This is something close to a 10 minute assignment once you get the hang of it. There is every reason for you to want to get this stuff into muscle memory early, because every assignment gets committed to github! 

You may save time, in the end, by repeating this assignment until it gets super easy and boring.

For example

- Assignment0b
- Assignment0c
- Assignment0d
- Assignment0e

You can d0 this as many times as you wish, you'll just have to delete the repositories from your github when they start feeling like clutter. Allow for about 20-30 seconds to delete a repository from github, once you learn it.
